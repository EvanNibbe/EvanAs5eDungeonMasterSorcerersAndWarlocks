The backgrounds with the important spells for the game (having spells that don't appear on the Sorcerer or Warlock spell list are the ones from Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica. The ones that offer healing are the Boris Legionaire (Aid + paladin-esque spells), and the Selesnya Initiate (Aid+Conjure Minor Elementals). If you take a background with a healing spell, take a race that does not offer healing spells in order to maximize the breadth of your abilities.
